If those dreams I saw really happened, \nthen this guy is...
Eggman!
Is he going to fight him?
I prepared the Egg Carrier 2 \njust in case for times like this.
Listen, Chaos! \nIf you won't follow my orders...!
You have no reason to exist!
Aaaaahhhhh!
Damn... he's out of control!
It's you... isn't it?
The one who sealed Chaos \nin the Master Emerald...
Tikal...?
My soul has always been alongside \nhim in the Master Emerald...
His heart is filled with \nanger and sadness...
And if it goes on, he'll destroy \nthis world just like he did before!
He has absorbed the \npower of the Emeralds...
We must hurry and seal him \ninside the Master Emerald again!
We can't do that!
Won't that just be \nthe same as before?!
His heart will still be bound \nby anger and sadness.
He will never be free!
Then what should we do...?
