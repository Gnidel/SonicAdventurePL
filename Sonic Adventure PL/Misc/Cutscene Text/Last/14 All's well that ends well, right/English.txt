Chaos has changed again.
This time for the better.
Yeah!  Super Sonic must have 
neutralized it, so it's nice again.
These are the Chao 
you were protecting.
They stayed alive for generations
and now live peacefully with humans.
The fighting's over.
Harmony's restored, and life goes on.
Thank you so much!
All's well that ends well, right?
Sonic?
