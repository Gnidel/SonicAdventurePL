Here...
You guys?!
Chaos drew power out of the \nEmeralds with anger and sadness...
But I'm sure you know the real \nway to use them, Sonic!
I hate to admit it... \nBut you're the only one who can do it!
Anger and sadness aren't the only \nway to draw power out of the Emeralds.
We care about Sonic, and he \ncares about us! That kind of heart...
... Can create tremendous power!
