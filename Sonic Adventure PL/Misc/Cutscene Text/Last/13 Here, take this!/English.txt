Hey, Sonic!
Amy!
Here, take this!
Hey guys, what's up?
Chaos only used the negative power 
of the Emeralds.
Sonic, you should be able to 
harness their real power!
As much as I hate to admit it, 
I think Tails is right about this!
Negative forces aren't the only way to
empower the Chaos Emeralds.
Our positive feelings toward 
each other can make them work.
Our hearts together form awesome 
power.
