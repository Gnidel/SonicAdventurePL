Get out of my way!
No way!
Did you hear what I said?
I won't obey!
We need those 7 Emeralds 
to give us total power!
It's power for the people. And...
they are your people too, you know!
We must get that Emerald!
Greed is our enemy!
Once it starts, 
you will always want more!
Please don't do this.  I beg you!
Bah!
I don't listen to the words 
of a child.
Ready, men!  Charge!
Father!
