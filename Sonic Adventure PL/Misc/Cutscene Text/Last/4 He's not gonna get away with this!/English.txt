Sonic... uhhh, sorry!
Knuckles!  And Eggman?  
What happened here?
He stole my Chaos Emeralds!
And Chaos is still alive!
What?!
Aaarrgh!  
He's not gonna get away with this!
Hey Eggman!  Wait up!
Sonic... 
Chaos is a fearsome beast!
If he gets that last Chaos Emerald, 
we're done for!
No need to explain, we'll get on it!
Tails!?
Right!
Wha...?!
Aw, Gee...!
