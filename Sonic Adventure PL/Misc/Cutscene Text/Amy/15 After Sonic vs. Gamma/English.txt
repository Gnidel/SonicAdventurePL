Please stop!
Amy!
That's one of Eggman's clunkers.
Outta my way!
No!
He helped me before 
by letting me escape.
This robot is different!
You don't need to hurt him, okay?
Amyâ€¦
Okay, I guess I'll let him go, then.
The Egg Carrier's losing altitude!
We're fresh outta time!
Take Amy and clear out, fast!
What about you?
I'll nail that Eggman!
Can't let him escape!
I knew you would save me, Sonic.
You're my hero!
Uhhh, you okay?
It's dangerous here.
Don't pay attention to Eggman
anymore. Free yourself. Come on!
Why are you helping me?
I said we'd be friends
and I'm returning your favor.
Even this birdie wants you 
to be free.
Eggman's not the kind of man
you should work for.
Amy, come on!  Let's get going!
Until we meet again, Mr. Robot!
Take care of yourself!
