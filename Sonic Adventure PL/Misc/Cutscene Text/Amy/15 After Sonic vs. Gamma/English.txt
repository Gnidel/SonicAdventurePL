Stop!
Amy!?
That's Eggman's mech! \nMove aside!
No!
This robot helped us escape.
He's not evil!
So-Sonic... Please stop!
Amy...
I understand... \nI guess you have your reasons.
Hey, Sonic! \nThis ship is losing altitude!
We don't have time! Tails, \ntake Amy and get out of here!
What about you?
I'll follow Eggman! \nI can't afford to ignore him!
Ah, Sonic, he always comes \nto help no matter what happens!
Hey, are you alright?
It seems dangerous here.
Don't listen to Eggman \nand get out of here quick!
...Why...Why... are you helping me?
Didn't I say next time we met, \nit would be as friends?
This birdie is really worried \nabout you, too.
Don't be on Eggman's side!
Amy, let's go!
I'm sure we'll see \neach other again, Mr. Robot!
