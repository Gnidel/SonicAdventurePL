Boooriiing!
I look over there... \nI look over here...
But no matter where I look, \nthe scenery is always the same.
I sure miss the good old days 
when I chased after Sonic.
Every day was exciting...
Full of adventures \nand blood-boiling thrills...
But then he suddenly disappears, \nleaving me behind.
Aaahh. I wonder if something \nexciting will happen again...

Eh? \nIt's cloudy all of a sudden?
That's awful! The weather \nforecast didn't say it was going to rain!
