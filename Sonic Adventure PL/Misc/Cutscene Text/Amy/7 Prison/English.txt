Huh?
Wh-What?
Hand over the bird.
No...!
Calmly hand over the bird.
When I say no, \nI mean no!
Why not?
Do I need a reason?
Let's hear it then. What \ndo you intend to do with the bird?
I have no information.
You don't know...?
But I know you're not going \nto treat it kindly.
Hey, please! Help us!
If you feel even the smallest bit \nof sympathy for this bird!
Does not compute.
Why do you try so hard to \nhelp a complete stranger?
Does not compute...
I see...
Eggman doesn't teach \nyou these things...
Wh-What's wrong, birdie!?
Get out of here.
Eh?
Why?
This place is dangerous...
Hurry! We will arrive \nat the Mystic Ruins base soon.
You...?
You seem different from \nthe other Eggman mechs.
If you're really not evil...
Then the next time we meet, \nit'll be as friends!
