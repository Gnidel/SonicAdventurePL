Whoah!   Hey, it transformed!   
Did you see that?
Now how are we gonna get to 
the bridge?
I hate it when he doesn't listen to me!
He he he he he!   I guess you
weren't expecting that, were you?
There's only one way to get to me,
Sonic.
And that's through the Sky Deck!
I doubt if you can make it!
Ha haaaaaa!   I dare you!
Just watch me!   Bring it on, Eggman!
