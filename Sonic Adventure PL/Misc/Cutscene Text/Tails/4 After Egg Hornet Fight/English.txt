Heh, all bark and no bite.
An opening!
Oh no!
Alright, Chaos! Take this!
Chaos...?
That's the thing from before...!

Ooh!
It's happening exactly as it \nsaid on the stone tablet!
Mwahahaha, Sonic!
Chaos here becomes stronger \nwith every Emerald he gets.
If I collect all seven, he will \ngrow into the ultimate monster!
I'll use him to destroy \nStation Square...!
And build my ideal city \nover the ruins, Eggmanland!
Muhahaha! Alright, Chaos!
We're leaving to look\n for the next Emerald!
That blasted Eggman!
If that monster keeps transforming,\nthere's gonna be big trouble!
Like we'll let Eggman have his way!
If we don't let him get the Emeralds, \nChaos shouldn't transform any further!
Sonic!
Let's stall them by collecting \nthe Chaos Emeralds!
