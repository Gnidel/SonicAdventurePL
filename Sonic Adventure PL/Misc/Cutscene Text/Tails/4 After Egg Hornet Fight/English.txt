That was just too easy!
Gotcha!  
Hey!   He snagged it!
Chaos could use a little snack!
Who's Chaos?
That's the monster 
I saw the other day.
Uh, Monster?
Yes, yes, yes!   
It's really happening! 
Just as the stone tablets 
said it would!
Ha ha ha ha!  
Hear this, Sonic!
Chaos' strength increases every time
I give him a Chaos Emerald.
All he needs is 7 Emeralds
to become invincible!
Then he will turn Station Square
into rubble.
Upon which I will build 
the ultimate city, Robotnikland!
Ha ha ha ha!  
You ready, Chaos?
Let's go find the next Emerald.
Come on!
Thank goodness they're gone.
Good riddance!
We can't let that monster get
any bigger. It could get ugly!
You're right, 
Chaos must be stopped!
And he can be if we keep him
away from more Emeralds, right?
So what do you say, Sonic?
Let's find the Chaos Emeralds 
before Eggman does!
