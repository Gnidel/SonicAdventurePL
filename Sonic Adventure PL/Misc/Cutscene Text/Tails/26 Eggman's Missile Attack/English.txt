That's Eggman!  I wonder
what happened to Sonic? 
I'm finished!
Chaos was defeated, and now 
my Egg Carrier is ruined!
No matter!   I will destroy
Station Square anyway!
If that missile is launched...
Ready?   Fire!
Aah!  No!   It was a dud!
I can't believe this!
Ah!  I'll go and deal 
with this myself!    
Oh, no!
I'd better get to that missile
before he detonates it!
