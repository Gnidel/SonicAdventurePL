Eggman!? I wonder what \nhappened to Sonic...?
Chaos has been defeated,
and the Egg Carrier has sunk.
In that case, I'll do whatever it \ntakes to destroy Station Square! 
If that missile is launched...!
Now, FIRE!
Oh! \nIt didn't explode!
Gah, \nwhat happened?
Damn it! \nI'll go check what's going on myself!
Th-This is bad!
If I don't outrun him, \nEggman will blow up the missile!
