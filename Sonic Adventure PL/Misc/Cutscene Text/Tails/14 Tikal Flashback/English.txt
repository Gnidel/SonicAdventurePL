	The servers are 
the 7 Chaos Emeralds.
Hello there, friend. 
How are you?
Umm... What were you saying
before?
Huh?
It's something 
my grandmother taught me.
I'm never to forget it.   
It goes like this...
	'The servers are the 7 Chaos.'
	'Chaos is power... 
	Power enriched by the heart.'
	'The controller is the one 
	that unifies the Chaos.'
But I'm still not sure 
what it all means.
But the number 7...
Is the same as the number of
Emeralds there are.
Emeralds?
Forgive me, but I don't think
we've ever met before...
I'm Tikal...   And you are?
