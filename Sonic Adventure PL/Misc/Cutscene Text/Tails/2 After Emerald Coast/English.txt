Boy, you're lucky 
I saw you come down!
So, what went wrong, anyway?
It's not like you 
to crash like that.
Yeah, it's just that I'm testing
a new prototype power supply,
and it's not fully compatible
yet!
You can always borrow my plane,
the Tornado, if you want.
Thanks, Sonic.
But if I can make this work,
it'll run circles around yours.
Check out this power supply!
It's a Chaos Emerald!   
No way!
I was lucky to find 
one of the 7 Chaos Emeralds.
They have unlimited mystic
powers.
Now I want to harness 
that power to fly my plane.
Let's go to my workshop 
in the Mystic Ruins,
and I'll show you 
what I've been working on.
We'll go to the station,
hop on a train
and get there in no time!
