I'm just glad I happened \nto see you up there.
More importantly... \nWhat happened?
It's not like you to crash \na plane like that.
I was testing a new model.
Looks like there was a \nmalfunction in the power system.
There's the Tornado I left in your \ncare if you need a plane, you know.
Hehe, this time I'm thinking of \nsomething even more amazing!

I've got this, too... Here you go!
Wow! \nA Chaos Emerald!
Yup! \nI picked up one of the seven.
A mysterious gem that \nproduces infinite power...
I believe I can use it \nas a power source, somehow.
Oh, right, let's go to my workshop!
There's something I want to show you.
It's in the Mystic Ruins.
By taking a train from the station, \nyou can get there in no time!
