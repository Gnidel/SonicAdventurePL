Whoa! Oh no, the Emeralds!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
And they're all mine!
Eggman's back!
He's got the Emeralds!
You two are bumbling idiots,
you know that!
Hey... Those are...
 the Chaos Emeralds! 
You are so easily tricked!
All I did was wait for you
to bring it to me!
What the heck is 
he talking about, anyway?
Don't you realize 
when you've been tricked?
Tricked?   
No one makes a fool out of me!
Way to go, Knucklehead!
Ha ha ha ha!  Four!  
Count 'em, 4 Emeralds!
I summon Chaos!   
Come forth!
 Here!   Eat up!
Oh no...   
It's changing again!
We gotta stop this, fast!
