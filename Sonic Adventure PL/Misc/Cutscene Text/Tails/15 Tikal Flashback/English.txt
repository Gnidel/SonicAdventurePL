What must be done.\nThe seven chaos.
Oh, hello. \nHow are you doing?
Um... What was that just now...?
Ah...
Those are words my granny told me. \nShe said it's an old legend.
And that I mustn't ever forget it. \n...It goes like this.
What must be done. \nThe seven chaos.
Chaos is power.\nPower comes from the heart.
The master of that is the one \nwho controls chaos.
...I may not understand what \nit's supposed to mean...
But I'm caught up in \nthe number seven. 
Is the same number as \nthe amount of Emeralds there are...
Emeralds...
This is the first time we've met.
What's your name? \nI'm Tikal...
