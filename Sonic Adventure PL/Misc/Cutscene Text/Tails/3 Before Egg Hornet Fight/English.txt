Well, well, well...
If it isn't Sonic and Tails!
It's Eggman!
Silence!
I am Dr. Robotnik,
the most cunning scientific
genius in the world.
Yeah right, Dr. Eggman!
Enough!  I've been 
working on a master plan,
but now it's time to 
put it to work!
That usually means trouble,
coming from you.
Don't even try to 
interfere this time.
Give me that Chaos Emerald,
or else!
Or else, what?   Huh?
Or else I'll take it 
from you... the hard way!
