Hoohohoho! Sonic and Tails!
Dr. Eggman!
Indeed!
I am the world's 
greatest scientific genius, \nDr. Eggman!
...Long time no see.
I've stayed quiet for a while, 
but I'll be getting busy again.
Are you planning to cause trouble again?
This time, \nI won't let you get in my way!
Now kindly hand over your \nChaos Emerald. Or else...
Or else...?
Or else I'll take it from \nyou by force!
