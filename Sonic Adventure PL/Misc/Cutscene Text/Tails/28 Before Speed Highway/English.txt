It's over there!
I've go to somehow outrun \nEggman and deal with the missile!
But... if I don't make it in time, \nthis city will go up in smoke...!
So-Sonic!
I've changed thanks to my \nencounter with Sonic...
But I can't just keep \nrunning behind him.
I'm just going to have to run \nwith my own strength someday...!
