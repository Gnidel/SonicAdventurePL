Stop it, Sonic!
Step aside, Amy! 
Out of my way!
No! This robot is my friend.
He helped me.
Don't hurt him.
Okay.   
Whatever you say.
You must have your reasons...
Hey, this ship is losing 
altitude!
Hurry, Tails!   
Take Amy and get out of here!
But what about you?
I'll find that Eggman 
and put him out of commission!
