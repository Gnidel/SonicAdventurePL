It sure has been a long time,\nin any case!
Yeah, guess so.
More importantly...\nWhat happened?
It's not like you to crash \na plane like that.
I was testing the new model.
I guess the transmission system's\nstrength was weak.
There's the Tornado I left in your\ncare if you need a plane, you know.
Hehe, this time I'm thinking of \nsomething even more amazing!
I've got this, too...\nHere you go!
WHOA!   \nA Chaos Emerald!
Yup! I picked up one of the seven.

A mysterious gem that produces\ninfinite power...
I believe I can use it as a\npower source, somehow.
Oh, right, let's go to my workshop!
I've got something I want to \nshow you!
It's at the Mystic Ruins.
By taking a train from the station, \nyou can get there in no time!
