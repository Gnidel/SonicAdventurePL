Hey Sonic.  
Long time no see, huh?
I'm just glad you're okay.
What happened, anyway?
You're too good of a pilot 
to just crash like that.
That was a test run using 
a new prototype propulsion system.
It's got a few bugs to iron out.
Why not just use my plane, 
the Tornado?
Thanks, but you gotta check out
my newest power supply!
Ta dahhh!
WHOA!   
A Chaos Emerald!
Yep! I just happened to find 
one of the 7 Emeralds
during one of my test flights. 
This thing's got unlimited power,
ya know...
So I figured, why not use it 
to power my plane. Super charged!
You gotta come over to 
my workshop, Sonic!
I've got something I've gotta 
show you!
It's in the Mystic Ruins.   
The fastest way is by train.
Let's go!
