Oh no, the Chaos Emeralds...
Ahhh!  Eggman!
Ha... 
like taking candy from a baby!
That's a Chaos Emerald!
That's right, fool, 
you made it all too easy!
You practically gave them 
to me!
Hold it right there, creep!  
You can't get away with this...!
Knuckles, don't tell me 
Eggman tricked you again?
Me?   What about you?
Way to go, Knucklehead!
Now, 
I have 4 lovely Emeralds...
Chaos...
These are for you, my friend...
Ah!   He transformed again!
Man, no one ever cuts us any slack!
