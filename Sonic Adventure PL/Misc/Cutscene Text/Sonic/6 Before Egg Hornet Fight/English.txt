Ha ha ha ha!  
If it isn't Sonic!
Look!   
It's a giant talking egg!
Silence!
I am Dr. Robotnik,
the greatest scientific genius 
in the world!
Whatever you say, Eggman!
Enough!  I've got big plans, and
now I'm gonna put them to work!
You're always up to no good.
Now what d'ya want?
I want all of the Chaos Emeralds.
Better not interfere!   
Or else!
Or else 
what, ya big loser?
Or else I'll take them from you
by force... the hard way!
