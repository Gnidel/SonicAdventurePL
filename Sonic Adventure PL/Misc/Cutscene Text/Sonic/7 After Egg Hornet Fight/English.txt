All bark and no bite!
An opening!
Alright, Chaos! Take this!
Chaos...?
That's...
the thing from before...!
Ooh! It's happening exactly as \nit said on the stone tablet!
Mwhahaha, Sonic!
Chaos here becomes more powerful \nwith every Chaos Emerald he gets.
If I collect all seven,
he will grow into \nthe ultimate monster!
I'll use him to destroy \nStation Square!
And build my ideal city over the \nruins,
Eggmanland!
Mwahaha! Alright, Chaos! We're \nleaving to look for the next Emerald!
Sonic!
If that monster keeps transforming, \nit will mean big trouble!
That blasted Eggman!
If we don't let him get the Emeralds, \nChaos shouldn't transform any further!
Sonic! Let's forestall them by \ncollecting the Chaos Emeralds!
