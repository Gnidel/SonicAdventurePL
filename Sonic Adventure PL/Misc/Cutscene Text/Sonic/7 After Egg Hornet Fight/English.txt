Well, that wasn't so hard!
AHA!
Come on Chaos, time to eat!
Chaos?
Oh no, isn't that the same monster
I saw the other day...
Ooooh Yes!   It's just as 
the stone tablets predicted.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
His strength increases every time
I feed him a Chaos Emerald! 
With all 7 Emeralds in him, 
he'll be invincible!
And work for me!
Together, we'll destroy 
Station Square!
And on its ruins, I'll build 
Robotnikland, the ultimate city!
Where I will rule it all!
Come on Chaos!   Let's find 
another Emerald, shall we?
Sonic!
We can't let him get away 
with this.   Can we?
No way, Tails!
Without more Emeralds, 
the monster can't transform, so...
It's up to us to get the Emeralds
before Eggman does, huh?
