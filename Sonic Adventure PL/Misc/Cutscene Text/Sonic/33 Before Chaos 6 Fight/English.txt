Am I too late...!?
Chaos... is this \nthe same thing from before?
Wahahaha!
Alright! Good going!
F-Froggy!
I-I've got to save Froggy!
Is that frog your friend?
Alright! \nLeave it to me!
Wahahaha!
I have collected six Chaos Emeralds!
I also recovered the tail Chaos lost \nwhen he broke up during his resurrection!
Only one Chaos Emerald remains!
I won't let you have your way, \nEggman!
Hmph!
Even with just six Emeralds, it should\nbe enough to beat the likes of Sonic!
Go Chaos! \nBeat him to a pulp!
