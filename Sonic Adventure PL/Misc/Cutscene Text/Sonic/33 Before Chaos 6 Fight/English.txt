Oh no!  Not again!
Chaos!   
Could this be the same beast?
Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Oh, yes!  
Attack Sonic, now!
Froggy!
I must save Froggy!
If he's your friend, 
I'll help you.
Just leave it to me!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Now I have 6 of 
the Chaos Emeralds.
There's only one more 
left to find.
I even found 
Chaos' missing tail!
You won't get away 
with this, you madman!
I will!
You're no match for Chaos - even
though he's not perfected yet.
Okay Chaos! Destroy them all...
Immediately!
