Behold, my flying fortress!
My creation, the Egg Carrier.
Beware. Chaos' true power is
yet to be unleashed.
Ha ha ha ha ha...  
We shall meet again!
Hurry, Sonic!   
What are we waiting for?
My workshop's close,
so let's go get the Tornado
and go after him!
Good idea!
Hey Sonic!
You go on ahead without me.
I have some things I need to
take care of.
No problem, Knuckles!
We'll take care of 
everything here.
Let's move!
