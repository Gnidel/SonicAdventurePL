Eggman!   Give me back
the Master Emerald!
Knu... Knuckles!
Uhhh, this isn't 
what you're after!
Huh, you're right!
That's okay, though.  I can use you
as a guinea pig to test it.
Chaos!   Chaos!
	Chaos?
It's that creature again!
The same one I saw on 
my island.
He was there when 
the Master Emerald shattered,
I'm sure of it.
He saved me the trouble of 
looking for him.
Now I'll get him good!
Ha ha ha ha ha!   
Way to go, Chaos!
Hah! Changing shape won't
scare me!
Fine!   
Give it your best shot!
