Hey, Dr. Eggman! \nGive me the Master Emerald!
Gah, Knuckles!
Y-You're wrong!! \nThis isn't the Master Emerald!
Um... \nIt sure isn't.
Hmph, whatever. Now let me put \nyour skills to the test with an opponent!
Chaos! 
Chaos?
That's...
It doesn't quite ring a bell...
But no, there's no 
mistaking it!
The one who \nbroke the Emerald...
You saved me the time looking \nfor him. I gotta thank you for that!
Muhahahahaha! \nGood going, Chaos!
N-No way...! \nHis appearance changed...?
Hmph, \nthat bluffing won't work on me!
