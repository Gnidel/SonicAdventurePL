Bah!   So what 
if you won this time.
You have yet to see 
the true powers of Chaos!
Yeah yeah, that still doesn't

I know something that might.
It's about Sonic.
What?
What about Sonic?
He's after the pieces of 
the Master Emerald, too!
What do you mean?
You're not the only one on
a wild goose chase, idiot!
Why should I ruin your 
surprise?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
I wonder what he meant by that?
I'd better find Sonic.
