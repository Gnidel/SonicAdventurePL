Aarghh!   Not again...
I hate you!
Hey, Sonic!
There you are, Knuckles. 
About time!
I will return!
Eggman!   Come back!
I'd better let Sonic handle it from here.
He'll do okay.
Now... I must return to 
Angel Island and the Master Emerald.
No!  It can't be!
I guess he didn't get enough
the first time!
You can't stop me from 
restoring the Master Emerald!
