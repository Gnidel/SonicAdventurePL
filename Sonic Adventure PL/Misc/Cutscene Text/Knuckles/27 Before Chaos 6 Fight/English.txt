EEK! No way... \nThis is ridiculous...!
Sonic!
Yo, Knuckles. \nYou're late!
Goodbye, Sonic!
Eggman! Wait!
I wanted to settle things with \nEggman, 
but I guess Sonic beat me to it.
Oh well. My duty is to restore \nthe Master Emerald, after all.
Wha...! \nDid you come back to life?!
I guess you're not just \ngoing to let me go home, huh.
I will restore the Master Emerald! \nAnd I won't let you get in my way!
