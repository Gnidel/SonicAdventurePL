Father!   Please don't!
Tikal, the 7 Emeralds are 
essential to our survival.
It is for the good of all 
our people.
How can I make you understand?
Attacking other countries,
stealing and killing...
can't be the right path 
to peace.
No one has the right to 
take their holy grounds.
I beg you father!
