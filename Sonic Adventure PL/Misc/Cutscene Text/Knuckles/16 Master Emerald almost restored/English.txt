What... I'm back in front of
the altar!
This is beginning to blow
my mind!
Wait a minute... 
I remember...
The broken pieces of 
the Master Emerald...
I have to restore them to 
where they belong.
It's still incomplete!
I need to find the remaining pieces.
Wherever they are.
Hey look!   
It's Eggman's flying fortress.
That's where the rest of 
the pieces must be.
But I don't know where 
that ship is.
Hey!   Isn't that 
one of Eggman's robots?
I know... I'll follow it
back to Eggman's base!
Here I come, Eggman!
