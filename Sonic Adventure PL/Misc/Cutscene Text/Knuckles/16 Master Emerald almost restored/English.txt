This place... \nAm I in front of the altar!?
But... \nwhat was that just now?
... Ah, I almost forgot!
I've managed to recover \nplenty of Master Emerald pieces,
so I should put them back \non the altar at once. 
It's still not enough...!
Where are
the remaining shards...?
This is... \nEggman's flying fortress!
Is it telling me the Master Emerald \nshards are in that thing?
But... \nHow am I going to find it?
An Eggman robot?
...That's it. I follow him, \nhe may lead me to the base.
Let's give it a shot!
