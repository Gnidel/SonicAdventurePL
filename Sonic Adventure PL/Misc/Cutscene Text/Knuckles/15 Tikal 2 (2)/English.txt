You're here, aren't you? \nListen to me!
My father and others \nwill come here soon.
This time, \nit'll be different...!
Listen, \ntake everyone and flee!
Please!
I see... \nYou say that you can't leave.
I understand. I'll try to speak \nwith my father one more time.
I wish I could come \nhere with good news...
It'll be fine. \nThere's nothing to worry about.
I've got to do something... \nI've got to...!
