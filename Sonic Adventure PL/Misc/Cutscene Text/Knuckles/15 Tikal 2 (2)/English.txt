I beg of you.   Hear me now.
My father is coming here soon.
And I fear what may happen.
You must take everyone 
away from here!
Oh please!
So, are you saying you can't
leave this place?
I understand... 
Let me talk to my father again!
There must be a better way 
to do this.
Don't worry, my friends.
I won't let you down.
I must do something... quickly.
