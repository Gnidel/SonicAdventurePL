As far back as I can remember,
I've been living here, 
on this dark island...
Always guarding 
the Master Emerald
from anything 
that could harm it.
I don't know 
why I was given this job...
Why it was my fate...
Destined to be here...
forever!
What the...?
What's going on here?
Oh no!
Something's happened to
the Master Emerald!
Huh?   Who are you?
Did you do this?   
Ohhh, I'll get you for this!
Ooomph!
Ugh agh! Hey, no fair!
Wait!
What's happening to you?
Come back here!
Wow!   That was incredible!
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh no!   
It's starting to happen.
Without the Master Emerald's 
power,
this whole island will 
fall into the ocean!
