I've been on this floating island
for as long as \nI can remember.
Guarding the giant gem \ncalled the Master Emerald
all alone...
I don't know the reason why.
It's just how it is...
Right now... \nand in the future, too...
What the!?
Who are you...?
Ah!
The Master Emerald!
Huh?   Who are you?
Was this your doing? \nY-You'll pay for that...!
Wah!
Damn it!
Ah, wait!
What is he, anyway...?
It's started!
Without the \nMaster Emerald...
...and its power to \nkeep the island afloat,
it'll sink again...!
