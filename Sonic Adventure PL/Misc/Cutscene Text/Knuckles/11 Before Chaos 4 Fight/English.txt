Oh no!   
The Chaos Emeralds...!
Eggman!   
What's he doing here?
Ha! That's all there is to it.
You guys are too easy!
That's a Chaos Emerald!
First come, first served,
they say.
And you serve me too well
for your own good!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
You can't get away with this!
Knuckles, did you let him
trick you again?
Like, you weren't?
Smooth move, Knucklehead!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 
I've got 4 Emeralds now.
Here, Chaos!
Come here, my hungry pet!
Now look what he is!
No problem.   I'll make him eat dirt!
