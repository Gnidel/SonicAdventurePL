Huh... er... wha?
Froggy, is that you?
You're lookin' kinda 
weird, good buddy.
What's up with the tail?
Hey, wait a minute!   
You swallowed my lucky charm.
Come back here... 
What's wrong with you?
Something's not right. We've always 
been friends... for years.
Froggy!   Wait up!    Oh, dear!
