Stop, Mr. Robot!
Amy...?
Hey, Mr. Robot.   
I know you're not an evil sort.
Wait!   Remember me?
Amy?
Huh!   I really don't get this.
Sonic, look! 
The Egg Carrier's losing altitude!
We've gotta split.   
Take Amy and go!
What will you do?
I'll nail that Eggman!
He must be stopped, at all costs!
Thanks again for saving me as usual,
Sonic.
And how are you, my metal friend?
It's dangerous here.
Why not leave Eggman and come
with us?
Why do you help me?
I told you we'd be friends 
the next time we met.
Even birdie wants the best for you.
You must ditch that awful Eggman!
Amy, come on!
We'll meet again, my robot friend!
