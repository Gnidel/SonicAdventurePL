Go away!
Give me the bird.
No way!
Resistance is futile; 
give me the bird!
I said NO!
Why not?
None of your business why not.
I want to know why you want it.
Data unavailable.
You don't even know?
I bet you'd be mean to him, 
you bully!
Why not help us out instead?
Don't you know how bad I feel?
Does not compute.
Why try to save that 
which is useless to you?
Does not compute.
I feel sorry for you!
Eggman failed to give you feelings.
Wait a minute, birdie!
Get going!
Huh?
Why are you letting us go?
It is dangerous here.
Hurry. We will be arriving at 
the Mystic Ruins base soon.
So... 
You're not like those other robots, 
huh?
You truly are a good person inside, 
aren't you?
I guess we can be friends then... 
Take care, ok?
