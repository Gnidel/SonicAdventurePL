Wh-What...?
Hand over the bird.
No...!
Calmly hand over the bird.
When I say no, I mean no!
Why not?
Do I need a reason?
Let's hear it, then. What do \nyou intend to do with this bird?
I have no information.
You don't know...?
But I know you're not \ngoing to treat it kindly.
Hey, please! \nHelp us!
If you feel even the slightest \nbit of sympathy for this bird!
Does not compute.
Why do you try so hard to \nhelp a complete stranger?
Does not compute.
I see...
Eggman doesn't teach \nyou these things...
Wh-What's wrong, birdie!?
Get out of here...
Eh?
Why?
This place is dangerous...
Hurry! We will be arriving at \nthe Mystic Ruins base soon.
You...?
You seem different than \nthe other Eggman mechs...
If you're really not evil...
Then next time we meet, \nit'll be as friends!
