No!  Don't go any closer!
I'm sorry, I see you must not be 
one of them, huh?
Did you notice the presence 
guarding these children?
He's a very loving 
and gentle creature.
These little creatures are too 
vulnerable without its protection.
This protection allows them 
to continue singing in peace.
Even I was surprised the first time 
I saw him.
Now my father is trying 
to take their sacred home.
It seems his heart is closed off 
to us all.
My true hope is that some day, 
we'll understand each other.
