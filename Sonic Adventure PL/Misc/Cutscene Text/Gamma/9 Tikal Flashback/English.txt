No! \nDon't come any closer!
...I'm sorry. \nYou seem... different.
Did you... notice him? The being \nthat is guarding these children.
He's a gentle person.
He's guarding these small creatures \nthat will disappear if left alone...
Because he's here, \nthey can sing in peace like this...
I was also surprised at \nfirst when I saw all this.
But father and the others are trying\nto take away these children's last home...
So he has closed off his heart...
I hope the day father \nunderstands comes someday...
