Okay then, Gamma... 
Here's your test.
If you want to stay on board, 
you must be able to pass it!
So pay attention to what I say.
The almighty Egg Carrier is a flying 
fortress that needs a good crew!
	Come forth, Beta!
I'd like you to meet your older brother 
E-101. Just call him Beta.
I am pitting the two of you
against each other,
and the winner serves on my ship.
I put my bets on Beta, but I owe you
at least a fair chance.
