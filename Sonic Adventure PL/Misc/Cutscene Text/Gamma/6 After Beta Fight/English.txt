Ho Ho ho!   
You surprised me, Gamma!
I had a funny feeling there was 
more to you than meets the eye.
I hereby grant Gamma permission to 
serve on board the Egg Carrier.
What? So you want 
to come along with us, eh?
Okay, okay...
We could always use a spare set 
of parts, I guess.
You have special permission.
